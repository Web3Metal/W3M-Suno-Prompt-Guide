# Example Thrash and Sludgecore Hybrid v1.0

[intro quick drum fill and feedback]
Ash on my tongue, smoke in my lungs
The city screams beneath its own weight
[bridge slow sludge riff]
Power lines hum like prayers gone wrong
I keep walking through the static haze

[thrash metal] [sludgecore] [distorted vocals] [feedback outro]

Fast thrash pace with sludge drag. Raw and physical.
Drums swing like collapsing machinery.
Vocals barked through a corroded PA.
Ends in feedback and tape hiss.

Version: v1.0
Notes: First pass. Try more midrange clarity next.
